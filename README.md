🔥 My Works — Interactive Portfolio Showcase
This is a responsive, minimal, and elegant project showcase section built for my personal portfolio website. Each project is displayed as a static image thumbnail, which transitions into a short video preview on hover—demonstrating the actual working site in action.

✨ Designed to highlight real-world work, not just static screenshots.

🧰 Features
🎥 Hover-to-Preview Video: Static screenshot fades into a muted looping video preview

🖼️ Clean UI: Modern card layout with soft shadows and subtle animation

⚙️ Lightweight Interaction: Uses minimal JavaScript for video control

💡 Scalable Structure: Easily add or remove projects using HTML

🎯 Accessible & Responsive: Built with best practices for layout and usability

🚀 Tech Stack
HTML5

CSS3 (custom transitions + flexbox/grid layout)

JavaScript (for hover play/pause control)

🧩 Why This Exists
Most portfolio showcases feel static and don’t really prove the work behind them. This project was built to change that—to let people see that every project actually works and feels good in action.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, a quick video is worth at least a few callbacks. 😉
